# Trader
A stupid buggy cryptotrader bot. Currently targeting the GDAX market, due to their fee-less limit orders. 

## Current state
Just subs to the websocket and prints the running ETH price

## Algorithm 
No idea yet - probably some sort of short-window derivitive analysis to predict slope changes
